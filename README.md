# opencv-examples

This repository contains the collections of OpenCV examples with Python and Java

1. colordetect.py

   This example detects the color of an object from a video stream. Currently it supports only four colors mainly
   Red, Green, Blue and Yellow. But I will be adding support for more colors later.
